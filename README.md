Concept

Description

Who doesn’t loves vacation ! There is market for explorers who want to visit new places  and for people who are not sure where to go.



Motivation for development?

All three of us love to Travel so we quickly agreed on concept, which got us excited.
Even though the requirement was 2 API, we agreed to do one API each.
We created user stories and prioritized them which gave us clarity. Helped us to focus on small meaningful wins.
